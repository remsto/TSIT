# TSIT with Depth map as input

This repository is a fork of [TSIT](https://github.com/EndlessSora/TSIT), a image-to-image translation neural network. 
It was made during a 3 months research project at [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paris.fr/)

The pdf file `Rapport.pdf` (in french) explains in details how it works, and what are the results.
